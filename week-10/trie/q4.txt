What are the two cases when deleting a word from a trie? 
How is each case handled?


Case 1: last letter of removed word has children
- so we just set the isWord to be false

Case 2: Last letter of removed word is a leaf node
- we don't want memory leaks so we recursively
keep removing the parent nodes until we reach a node that
is either the end of a word (isWord is True) or a node
that contains other children
