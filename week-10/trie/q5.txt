Autocomplete is a feature in which an application predicts
the rest of a word a user is typing. For example, 
if a user has typed in "th", then autocomplete may suggest 
the words "the", "they", "then", and so on.

a) Explain how a trie could be used to implement basic autocomplete, 
which suggests all possible words.

- store all words in a trie
- traverse the letters which a user has input until the last letter
- provide suggestions using the words formed by all the remaining nodes
in the trie

b) Users are much more likely to type some words than others, so ideally
autocomplete should suggest more likely words. For example, if a user has
typed "tho", autocomplete should suggest "though" instead of "thou". How
could you extend your solution so that autocomplete suggests more likely
words?

- each time we traverse a node in a search, we increment a counter
which keeps track of how many times we visit each node
- using this information, at a given node, we can check the counter
of the children nodes to see what words are used the most frequently
- potentially use an additional data strucuture such as a max heap
so that we can more efficiently get the most commonly used later words
