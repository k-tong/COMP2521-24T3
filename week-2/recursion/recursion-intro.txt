recursion: a technique where we call the same function in a
smaller size

Intuition:
- a problem may be solved recursively when you find yourself
solving the same/similar problem multiple times at a smaller size

Implementing:
Assume we know how to get the return value of the same function
at a smaller 'size'
Figure out how to use current position/node in combination
with these assumptions to get the result

Base case:
Eventually we get to a base case which will often have a more 
obvious return value
